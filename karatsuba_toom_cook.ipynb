So let's set aside \\#2 for now, and pretend that we only have to implement 2x2 multiplication.\n\nFurthermore, note that multiplication of numbers and multiplication of polynomials are very similar -- the only difference is that for numbers we have to propagate carries, and we don't have any such requirement for polynomials, so the latter is simpler. For example, take the following simple multiplication of two 2-decimal digit numbers:",

      "source": "Note that instead of 9 coefficient multiplications, we now have only 5, but we also have multiplications by constants, as well as divisions. Some of the multiplications and divisions would translate to shifts, since they're by powers of two, but there's at least one multiplication by 3, and one division by 6 (which can be done as a shift right followed by a division by 3).\n\n# Karatsuba as a special case of Toom-Cook\n\nFrom the analysis above, it should be clear that we can do something similar for $n \\times n$-word multiplications, and even $m \\times n$-word multiplications. But first, let's apply the same procedure to $2 \\times 2$ multiplication.\n\nRecall that we were multiplying (up to) linear polynomials, which would result in at most a quadratic (degree-2) polynomial. Therefore, that would require 2 points to interpolate, plus the leading coefficient.\n\nA natural choice would be $x_0 = 0, x_1 = 1$. Then the (almost) Vandermonde matrix would be\n\n$$\n\\left(\\begin{matrix}\n1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1\n\\end{matrix}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhich has inverse\n\n$$\n\\left(\\begin{matrix}\n1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n-1 & 1 & -1 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1\n\\end{matrix}\\right)\n$$\n\nIf you use this matrix, you end up with the original `karatsuba_mult_poly` algorithm. Then (I'd have to check this) if you instead use $x_0 = 0, x_1 = -1$, you end up with `karatsuba_mult_poly_alt`.\n\n# Lagrange interpolation theorem and Vandermonde matrices\n\nRecall that the Lagrange interpolation theorem states:\n\nGiven rational points $(x_0, y_0), \\dotsc, (x_n, y_n)$ such that all $x_i$ are distinct, there exists a unique polynomial $p$ of degree at most $n$ such that $p(x_i) = y_i$ for all $i$.\n\nThere are many proofs of this theorem, but for our purposes the most enlightening one is the procedure we used above, i.e. we can build a Vandermonde matrix for $x_0, \\dotsc, x_n$, i.e.\n\n$$\nA = \\left(\\begin{matrix}\nx_0^0 & x_0^1 & \\dotsc & x_0^n \\\\\nx_1^0 & x_1^1 & \\dotsc & x_1^n \\\\\n\\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\\nx_n^0 & x_n^1 & \\dotsc & x_n^n\n\\end{matrix}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhich, if it's invertible, has a unique inverse $A^{-1}$. Then apply $A$ to the column matrix $(y_1, \\dots, y_n)^T$ to get a column matrix of polynomial coefficients, which then produces a unique polynomial.\n\nNow the key step is inverting $A$, so we must show that $A$ is always invertible. By *waves hands* linear algebra, this is equivalent to showing that $\\det A \\ne 0$. But fortunately, Vandermonde matrices are well-studied, and a theorem shows that\n$$\n\\det A = (x_0 - x_1) \\dotsb (x_{n-1} - x_n) = \\prod_{i \\ne j} (x_i - x_j),\n$$\ni.e. the product of all the differences of the $x_i$. (See Wikipedia for a few proofs.) Therefore, $A$ is invertible as long as the $x_i$ are distinct, which they are by assumption.\n\n(Advanced note: note that it does _not_ necessarily hold that Vandermonde matrices are invertible over fields of positive characteristic, even though the expression for the determinant a priori looks like it should be non-zero for distinct $x_i$.)\n\nWhat about the \"almost\" Vandermonde matrix that we ended up with, that looks like:\n\n$$\nA' = \\left(\\begin{matrix}\nx_0^0 & x_0^1 & \\dotsc & 0 \\\\\nx_1^0 & x_1^1 & \\dotsc & 0 \\\\\n\\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\\n0 & 0 & \\dotsc & 1\n\\end{matrix}\\right)\n$$\n\nWell, by *waves hands* more linear algebra, the determinant of $A'$ reduces to exactly the determinant of the Vandermonde submatrix, which is non-zero.\n\nNote that matrix inversion involves division by the determinant, or something equivalent. Since in this case the determinant is the product of the differences of the $x_i$, this strongly suggests that we want to minimize such differences, i.e. we might want to pick consecutive integers. However, that can only get us so far, as the following proof shows.\n\n# Sketch of proof that division by a multiple of 3 is unavoidable for Toom-Cook\n\nWe build a Vandermonde matrix for at least four distinct numbers $x_0, x_1, x_2, x_3$. By the pigeonhole principle, at least two of these numbers have the same residue mod 3. Assume without loss of generality that $x_0 \\equiv x_1 \\bmod 3$. Then $3 \\mid (x_0 - x_1)$, and thus by the expression for the Vandermonde determinant, $3 \\mid \\det A$.\n\nEven though matrix inversion involves division by the determinant, this alone doesn't prove that division by 3 is unavoidable. For that we must look at the entries of the inverse matrix. By an [explicit formula](https://proofwiki.org/wiki/Inverse_of_Vandermonde_Matrix) for the inverse of the Vandermonde matrix, it has some entries of the form\n$$\n\\dfrac 1 {x_i \\, \\prod_{\\substack {1 \\mathop \\le m \\mathop \\le n \\\\ m \\mathop \\ne i} } (x_i - x_m) }\n$$\n\nTherefore, for $i = 0$, it has an entry of the form\n$$\n\\dfrac 1 {x_0 (x_0 - x_1) \\, \\prod_{\\substack {1 \\mathop \\le m \\mathop \\le n \\\\ m \\mathop \\ne 0, 1} } (x_0 - x_m) }\n$$\n\nTherefore, in the Toom-Cook algorithm this would translate into a division by $x_0 (x_0 - x_1) \\dotsb$, which is a multiple of 3.",
